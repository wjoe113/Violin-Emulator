Violin Emulator
By Joe, Vasily, Tony

This project is a small android violin emulator application. The purpose 
of this project is to emulate a real violin. Our project includes a
loading screen, 4 string objects, a display field for the note being
played, and a swipe tab.

To play the violin, the user must place a finger on the desired note and
swipe the swipe tab to play the note. The swipe tab simulates a bow
being pulled across a violin string.
